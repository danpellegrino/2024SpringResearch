# Exploring Signal Processing Techniques with WaveletComp in R
## Author: [Daniel Pellegrino](https://danieljpellegrino.com/)

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for the research project that I am conducting in Spring 2024.
The project is focused on exploring signal processing techniques with WaveletComp in R. The repository contains the following files:

1. `README.md`: A markdown file that provides a brief overview of the research project.
2. `code/`: A directory that contains the R code used in the project.
3. `data/`: A directory that contains the data used in the project.
4. `output/`: A directory that contains the output generated from the R code.
5. `manuscript/`: A directory that contains the manuscript for the research project.

## How to Install WaveletComp package
```{r}
install.packages("WaveletComp")
```

## Code
The `code/` directory contains the R code used in the project. The code is organized into the following files:

1. `waveletcomp_analysis.R`: An R script that contains the code for the signal processing analysis using the WaveletComp package.
2. `plotting.R`: An R script that contains the code for generating plots from the analysis.

## Data
The `data/` directory contains the data used in the project. The data is organized into the following files:

1. `signal_data.csv`: A CSV file containing the raw signal data used in the analysis.

## Output
The `output/` directory contains the output generated from the R code. 

## Manuscript
The `manuscript/` directory contains the manuscript for the research project. The manuscript is organized into the following files:

1. `manuscript.Rmd`: An R markdown file containing the text and code for the manuscript.
2. `manuscript.pdf`: A PDF file containing the compiled manuscript.
